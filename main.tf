 *
 * The following ACL rules are set:
 *
 * * Retroactively remove public access granted through public ACLs
 * * Deny updating ACL to public
 *
 * The following lifecycle rules are set:
 *
 * * Incomplete multipart uploads are deleted after 14 days.
 * * Expired object delete markers are deleted.
 * * Noncurrent object versions transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access storage class after 30 days.
 * * Noncurrent object versions expire after 365 days.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *

 *       source         = "trussworks/s3-private-bucket/aws"
